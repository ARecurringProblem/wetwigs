Welcome to my Bitwig presets repo, where you will find equal parts fun and horror!

## Phase-4
- **Industrial-Grade Demon Summoner:** Makes some spooOOoOoOOoOoky noises that one might find in a spoOOOooooooOOOoOOoOOoOky movie!
- **Porcupine Key:** Simple keyboard patch that reminds me of some Porcupine Tree songs.  Mod wheel controls timbre, aftertouch controls filter cutoff.
## Polysynth
- **Plucky Electro Bass:** Pretty self-explanatory, I think...if you can't figure it out then ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
